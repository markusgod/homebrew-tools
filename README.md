# Markusgod Tools
This is tap for tools that are not in the core repository and I'm too lazy to properly package, while still wanting autoupdates. 
Feel free to PR yours.

## How do I install these formulae?

`brew install markusgod/tools/<formula>`

Or `brew tap markusgod/tools` and then `brew install <formula>`.

## Documentation

`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://docs.brew.sh).
